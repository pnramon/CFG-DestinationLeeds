        <p>Looking to go walking in the beautiful countryside near Leeds? Then Ilkley is a
          perfect destination for you. It is situated in the Wharfe Valley, at the southern
          end of the Yorkshire Dales. It is the official starting point of the 84 mile Dales
          Way trail, which runs all the way up to Bowness-on-Windermere. Transport links in
          Ilkley are excellent. The town has a central train station as well as a smaller stop
          at Ben Rhydding which connects to the large cities of Bradford and Leeds.</p>
        <p>Ilkley is the ideal place to relax and treat yourself. There is nothing better
          than breathing in fresh air.  I have personally went there as a part of a walking
          tour organized by the University last November. Although there were some steep areas,
          it is an easy walk even for someone who never hiked like myself. Our group walked
          around and enjoyed exploring the area for around 4 hours in total. We took our time
          and stopped here and there to take pictures, but the pace is all up to you.</p>
        <p>Ilkley is also known for having cute little local cafes so if you have enough time,
          why not stop by?  There are a number of events through the year such as Ilkley Literature
          Festival, Ilkley Summer Festival and Real Food Ilkley Markets, so go and see for yourself.
